# Web3 Teaching Evaluation System
This is fully web3 technology based teaching evaluation system. It was my research project's implementation. I build this web application. My research title is 'Blockchain-based Teaching Evaluation System for Ensuring Data Integrity and Anonymity'. There was some limitation to this field and we solved existing problems and added few more things then proposed the system. This research is published on the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Engineering. Volume 10 2023.

## Features
### Administrator Functionalities:
* Login
* Logout
* Administrator can Create new student/faculty account
* View total students, total faculties, total courses and total evaluation.
* Administrator can View all courses
* Administrator can Create a course to the organization/ Assign a course to a faculty
* Administrator can View feedback/evaluations of all courses.
* Administrator can View faculty performance of every courses out of 100 percent to understand how a faculty is performing in cases.

### Faculty Functionalities 
* Login
* Logout
* Faculty can View assigned courses for the particular faculty.
* Faculty can view feedbacks/evaluation to their assigned courses only.

## Student Functionalities
* Login
* Logout
* Student can view their courses.
* Student can enroll into a course/ Self registration to a course.
* Student can give feedback/do evaluation to their enrolled course.

## Special Functionalities
* Proper authentication using Web3 technology
* If someone have password of any user but he/she cannot login instead of having username and password because I mapped everything with metaMask wallet address. If username password and metaMask wallet address is correct then the user can login only. This provide an extra layer of security.
* Protected path, user cannot get access to another user's path.
* Password encryption using bcrypt algorithm.
* Quite impossible to ha*ck.
* Data cannot be altered due to using Blockchain.
* Validations in every field and functionalities.
## Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript
* Solidity Programming Language
* Bcrypt Algorithm
* Hashing, Encryption/Decryption
* Smart Contract
* Ethereum Blockchain
* ReactJS
* MetaMask
* EtherJS
* Goerlitestnet
